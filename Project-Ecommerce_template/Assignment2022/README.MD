Please refresh the page after the button is pressed if nothing happens. 

0. the order doesnt really matter here, but you can try this:

1. you can start with logging in as an admin and add an image from the "pic" folder and
add it to the table. 

2. after that you can check that the product appears on the admin page and the mainpage. 

3. when clicking the link for the product it navigates to the product page where you can add to cart

4. after adding the product to cart, it displays in the shoppingcart.php where you can buy the product and the customer and order details will be sent to the database. 

5. you can see the orders and customers in a table on the adminpage where you can filter between country and time.

6. now you can log out and register a user and log in with that. then the admin page dissappears from the navbar and is not available since it is not an admin. 

7. you can also delete product from both admin page and the shopping cart with the selection form on both of the pages. 

other than the refresh error, the quantity doesnt add on each other when adding to shopping cart.

also if there is anything I forgot above, its just to try them :D

the most important thing is to refresh the page if nothing happens
